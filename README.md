# odin-etch-a-sketch
## Project: Etch-A-Sketch / The Odin Project 
<br>

## Summary ##
In this project, I built a browser-only, hybrid version of Sketchpad and 'Etch-A-Sketch' to test my DOM manipulation abilities. The project details can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). 

When finished, the product must have the following features:

1. It generates square grids out of div elements.
2. The grid cell div element should be created in DOM.
3. When hovered over, it leaves a pixelated trace-like effect that turns every grid cell black.
4. It requires a button that asks the user to enter a number (integer) ranging from 1 to 100.
5. After entering the proper number, the sketch pad will generate a square grid based on the user's selection (if 64, then 64 x 64 grid).
6. The grid must be refreshed each time the user enters a new value.
7. The grid must always be created in THE SAME TOTAL SPACE AS BEFORE (if 960px, then always 960px x 960px). 
8. There are two **extra credit** features to attempt, both of which are meant to alter the feature mentioned in No. 3 above: 1. It colors the cells at random. 2. From the first to the tenth cell, it gradually darkens by 10% before turning black in the remaining cells.

My final product can be found [here](https://kbelltree.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch/).
